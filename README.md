# 🤖 claude-squad

**claude-squad** is a terminal-based multi-agent system where Claude agents collaborate to complete markdown-defined tasks (called "tickets"). Each agent runs in a separate tmux pane, follows role-specific instructions, and communicates using natural language through a message-sending CLI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Multi-agent coordination using Claude in each pane
- 📄 Ticket-based task system powered by Markdown
- ⚙️ YAML-based agent configuration
- 🖥️ Pane orchestration via `tmux`
- 📬 Inter-agent messaging via CLI
- 🪪 Role-based behavior: president, leader, coder, tester, etc.

## 📦 Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
brew install tmux yq # macOS
```

### 2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/claude-squad.git
cd claude-squad
```

### 3. Define your agents
Edit agents.yaml to define agent roles, names, and instruction files:

```yaml
president:
  enabled: true
  instruction: instructions/president.md

multiagent:
  window_name: agents
  panes:
    - name: leader1
      instruction: instructions/leader.md
    - name: coder1
      instruction: instructions/coder.md
    - name: coder2
      instruction: instructions/coder.md
```

## 🚀 4. Run the system
```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Clean up any old multiagent sessions
- Launch a multiagent tmux session
- Launch a president session (if enabled)
- Assign titles and instructions to each pane
- Start Claude in each pane with the correct prompt

## 🖥️ 5. Open the agent consoles

In one terminal window:

```bash
tmux attach-session -t president
```

In a separate terminal window:

```bash
tmux attach-session -t multiagent
```

## 🏁 6. Kick Off the Mission!

Once you're inside the `president` tmux session, you can start the workflow by instructing the leader to begin processing tickets.

Inside the `president` session type in:

```bash
Complete all the todo tickets
```

## 🧠 How It Works

Each agent:

- Loads its identity and task from agents.yaml
- Follows instructions in instructions/{agent}.md
- Uses ./agent-send.sh to message other agents

Tickets live under:

```bash
tickets/
├── reference/ # Images or whatever you want reference in the ticket
├── todo/      # Incoming tasks
└── done/      # Completed tasks
```

## 💬 Example: Send a message
```bash
sh ./agent-send.sh coder1 "Please start working on 001_ticket_001.md"
```

```bash
sh ./agent-send.sh leader1 "ticket 001_ticket.md completed"
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep ticket file names sortable (e.g., 001_ticket.md, 0002_ticket.md)
- Keep roles focused on responsibilities
